    dircache_init(): buffer_alloc for each d_name in the opendirs array
        * the opendirs dirs array is statically allocated, there's no
        reason the d_name in it shouldn't also;
        * reason for buffer_alloc() is probably that d_name needs to be a pointer
    dircache_load(): first buffer_alloc(0) to determine the start of buffer
        * this is in within HAVE_EEPROM_SETTINGS, the first buffer_alloc()
          is to check whether the buffer start matches the buffer start
          in the dump on disk, if it it is the dump is loaded to memory as-is,
          otherwise dircache is fully reinitialized
        * this relies on reproducable boots (identical buffer_alloc() calls) and
          determininistic buffers from buffer_alloc(). This should work with
          buflib also. In any event, it only affects HAVE_EEPROM_SETTINGS (h100?)
          and it's probably non-fatal if it doesn't work anymore
    *dircache_build(): buffer_alloc()s if the dircache size is known (e.g.
          from previous boots), otherwise audiobuf is accessed directly.
        * in the first case, the buffer size is known and allocated,
          followed by a "transparent build" (i.e. in background);
          should be easily replacable with buflib
        * in the second case, the buffer size is unknown and a foreground
          build is started; this relies on no other thread being able temop to
          run for exclusive access; not possible with current buflib
            -> need to implement some buflib_get_all() which may possibly
            resizeable/reallocable
          (see also dircache_do_rebuild())
    usage of the allocation:
        if not buffer_alloc()d, it's only temporarilly used, probably no
        concurrent access (CA) issues (that or it would be completely
        broken currently)
        if buffer_alloc()'d, then the buffer is used throughout runtime to
        allocate dircache_entry structs and the d_name member of it (separately,
        d_name is allocated as needed); access happens via dircache_root and
        offset (dirache_root+dircache_size, etc)
    considerations for compaction
        dircache.c itself can probably handle compation just fine, since
        it's using an offset-to-pointer mechanism already and keeps track
        of all sub-allocations (via dircache_entry->next etc)
        however, dircache_get_entry_ptr() exports dircache_entrys (and thus d_names)
        from the buffer to the caller for unknown time; therefore compaction
        of this buffer is not always safe :(
        Additionally, a pointer to a dircache_entry is saved in DIR_CACHED,
        every DIR_CACHED is from the opendirs array (local to dircache.c)
        and they have a busy flag; DIR_CACHED is opaque for callers (so
        no direct dircache_entry access) and d_name is copied to separately
        allocated storage
        -> this perhaps needs a
        lock, user supplied buffer to copy the entry or invalidation (need
        to analyze the callers more; only tagcache.c and playlist.c so far)
apps/dsp.c
    dsp_timestretch_enable(): buffer_alloc() on boot, and only if timestretch
        is enabled. size is fixed.
    usage:
        the buffer is used for resamping, depending on timestretch.
        resample_buf is toggled between small_resample_buf and big_resample_buf.
        It's then used only used in resample(), apparently without yield().
    compaction:
        resample() doesn't know if it's a buflib buffer or a static
        buffer, so buflib_get_data() doesn't seem possible; but the compaction
        callback can detect this and act accordingly. Since resample() doesn't
        yield no CA is expected and compation should work without much hassle.

        Alternatively small_resample_buf could be made a buflib allocation as
        well, as it's unused if timestretch is enabled. Then resample()
        could call buflib_get_data() unconditionally. However, for speed,
        small_resample_buf is allocated in IRAM so it has a downside.
        (buflib allocs from IRAM with a separate buflib_context perhaps?).
